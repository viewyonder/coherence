All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`--purge` flag for `/coherence uninstall`.** Deletes all Coherence project files (hooks, agents, skills, SPEC docs, log files) after user confirmation. `CLAUDE.md` is left intact since it may contain non-Coherence content.
- **`--force` flag documented across site.** Updated wtf page, Agents component, and blog posts to reflect both `--force` and `--purge` flags.
- **Plugin cache cleanup on global uninstall.** `~/.claude/plugins/cache/viewyonder-coherence` is now removed during Step 6 (Global Cleanup).

### Changed

- Bump version to 1.7.0

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Updated README with all 11 sub-commands.** Added missing `hook`, `spec`, `config`, `status`, and `uninstall` to the Skills table. Added new "Sub-commands" section with descriptions, usage examples, and example output for every sub-command.
- Bump version to 1.6.1

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **`/coherence history` sub-command.** View activity log, enable/disable logging, clear log, and show summaries. Supports `--on`, `--off`, `--clear`, `--open`, and `--last N` flags.
- **Activity logging for hooks.** BLOCK and WARN decisions are logged to `.claude/coherence.log` when logging is enabled via a sentinel file (`.claude/coherence-log-enabled`). Opt-in, per-developer, gitignored.
- **Shared `_log.cjs` utility.** Hooks require this module and call `logEvent()` at decision points. Handles sentinel check, log rotation (100KB threshold, keeps 500 lines), and `try/catch` safety.
- Logging steps added to `check-principles`, `check-drift`, and `test-runner` sub-commands (SKILL-level log entries)
- `.claude/.gitignore` to exclude `coherence.log` and `coherence-log-enabled` from version control
- "What Happened" blog post explaining the rationale for activity logging

### Changed

- Updated `/coherence config` hook inventory to skip `_`-prefixed files (shared utilities)
- Updated README sub-commands table to include `history`
- Bump version to 1.6.0

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **`/coherence config` sub-command.** Read-only overview of the full local project configuration — hooks (with active/orphaned/missing status), agents, skills, SPEC documents, and project files. Cross-references hook files on disk against `settings.local.json` registrations.
- "The Whole Picture" blog post explaining the rationale for the config sub-command

### Changed

- Updated SPEC-SKILLS.md sub-command count from 9 to 10
- Updated blog post sub-command counts and tables
- Bump version to 1.5.0

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **`/coherence hook` sub-command.** Read-only report of all installed hooks — parses `settings.local.json`, checks file existence, reads JSDoc headers for enforcement level (BLOCK/WARN/INFO) and purpose. Groups by PreToolUse/PostToolUse and matcher.
- **`/coherence spec` sub-command.** Read-only report of all SPEC documents — scans `docs/SPEC-*.md`, reads verification metadata (last verified date, method), extracts one-line descriptions from Overview sections.
- "Show Your Work" blog post explaining the rationale for inspection sub-commands

### Changed

- Updated SPEC-SKILLS.md sub-command count from 7 to 9
- Bump version to 1.4.0

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Rename `check-architecture` sub-command to `check-principles`.** The old name suggested structural verification (like `check-drift`), when it actually checks adherence to the *principles* section of CLAUDE.md. The new name makes the distinction immediately clear.
- Updated all 18 files across SKILL.md (template + plugin), CLAUDE.md, README, SPEC documents, site pages, and changelog data
- Added "Names Are Load-Bearing" blog post explaining the rationale

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Add missing Consistency Reviewer to homepage agent cards (5 agents now shown, matching template)
- Update homepage sub-commands list to show all 5 `/coherence` sub-commands
- Fix Getting Started file tree to show consolidated `skills/coherence/` instead of old separate skill directories

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Unified `/coherence` command with sub-commands.** All skill functionality consolidated under a single entry point:
  - `/coherence init [--reset]` — setup wizard (was `/coherence`)
  - `/coherence check-drift [scope]` — SPEC drift detection (was `/check-drift`)
  - `/coherence check-architecture [path]` — architecture compliance review (was `/check-architecture`)
  - `/coherence test [scope]` — test runner (was `/test`)
  - `/coherence help` — show available sub-commands
- Wizard-generated projects now produce a single unified skill instead of three separate skills
- Updated all SPEC documents, READMEs, blog posts, and site pages to reflect new command names

### Removed

- `template/.claude/skills/check-drift/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
- `template/.claude/skills/check-architecture/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
- `template/.claude/skills/test/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
