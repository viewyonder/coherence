# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Rename `check-architecture` sub-command to `check-principles`.** The old name suggested structural verification (like `check-drift`), when it actually checks adherence to the *principles* section of CLAUDE.md. The new name makes the distinction immediately clear.
- Updated all 18 files across SKILL.md (template + plugin), CLAUDE.md, README, SPEC documents, site pages, and changelog data
- Added "Names Are Load-Bearing" blog post explaining the rationale

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Add missing Consistency Reviewer to homepage agent cards (5 agents now shown, matching template)
- Update homepage sub-commands list to show all 5 `/coherence` sub-commands
- Fix Getting Started file tree to show consolidated `skills/coherence/` instead of old separate skill directories

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Unified `/coherence` command with sub-commands.** All skill functionality consolidated under a single entry point:
  - `/coherence init [--reset]` — setup wizard (was `/coherence`)
  - `/coherence check-drift [scope]` — SPEC drift detection (was `/check-drift`)
  - `/coherence check-architecture [path]` — architecture compliance review (was `/check-architecture`)
  - `/coherence test [scope]` — test runner (was `/test`)
  - `/coherence help` — show available sub-commands
- Wizard-generated projects now produce a single unified skill instead of three separate skills
- Updated all SPEC documents, READMEs, blog posts, and site pages to reflect new command names

### Removed

- `template/.claude/skills/check-drift/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
- `template/.claude/skills/check-architecture/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
- `template/.claude/skills/test/` — merged into `coherence/SKILL.md`
