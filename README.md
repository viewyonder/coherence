# Coherence for Claude

**Maintain architectural coherence when AI writes your code.**

A system of hooks, agents, skills, and specification documents that encode your project's architectural constraints into the Claude Code development loop. Instead of catching violations during review, they're caught at the moment of creation.

## Install

**Step 1.** Add the marketplace source (once per machine):

```
/plugin marketplace add viewyonder/coherence
```

**Step 2.** Install the plugin into your project:

```
/plugin install coherence
```

Then run `/coherence:init` to launch the interactive setup wizard. It walks you through your stack, generates customized hooks, agents, skills, a `CLAUDE.md`, and `settings.local.json` — all tailored to your project.

---

## Manual Installation

If you prefer more control or can't use the plugin system, copy the template directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project

# Copy the .claude directory
cp -r /path/to/coherence/template/.claude .

# Copy the CLAUDE.md template
cp /path/to/coherence/template/CLAUDE.md .

# Copy the SPEC template and memory template
mkdir -p docs
cp /path/to/coherence/template/docs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md docs/
cp /path/to/coherence/template/docs/MEMORY.md docs/
```

Then customize manually:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Replace `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers with your project's values
2. **Hooks** — Edit the `// === CONFIGURATION ===` block at the top of each hook in `.claude/hooks/`. Remove hooks that don't apply and update `settings.local.json` accordingly.
3. **SPEC docs** — Copy `docs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md` to something like `docs/SPEC-API-SURFACE.md`, fill in your actual components, and run `/coherence check-drift` (project-local) or `/coherence:check-drift` (plugin) to verify.

## What's Inside

### The Four Layers

| Layer | What It Does | When It Runs |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hooks** | Enforce known constraints (block, warn, suggest) | Every file edit/write/commit |
| **Agents** | Detect drift and review architecture | On demand via skills |
| **SPEC Docs** | Define what "correct" means (falsifiable claims) | Referenced by agents and humans |
| **Skills** | Multi-step workflows with built-in compliance | User-invoked (`/coherence:<command>` via plugin, `/coherence <command>` locally) |

### Hooks (11 included)

| Hook | Enforcement | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `forbidden-imports.cjs` | Blocking | Block runtime-inappropriate APIs |
| `required-prefix.cjs` | Blocking | Enforce route path prefix |
| `boundary-guard.cjs` | Blocking | Enforce module boundaries |
| `test-gate.cjs` | Blocking | Block commits without tests |
| `data-isolation.cjs` | Warning | Warn on unfiltered DB queries |
| `delegation-check.js` | Warning | Warn on inline business logic |
| `terminology-check.cjs` | Warning | Enforce consistent terminology |
| `style-guard.cjs` | Warning | Enforce voice, tone, and structure rules |
| `state-flow.cjs` | Blocking/Warning | Enforce unidirectional state |
| `test-suggest.cjs` | Informational | Suggest running related tests |
| `change-suggest.cjs` | Informational | Suggest related actions |

### Agents (5 included)

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `architecture-reviewer` | Compliance check against CLAUDE.md principles |
| `drift-detector` | Compare SPEC docs against codebase reality |
| `code-reviewer` | Quality, security, and best practices review |
| `security-auditor` | OWASP-focused vulnerability detection |
| `consistency-reviewer` | Terminology, voice, and structural consistency |

### Skills (11 commands)

When installed as a plugin, each command is a separate skill invoked with colon syntax:

| Command | Category | What It Does |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| `/coherence:init [--reset]` | Setup | Interactive wizard to generate full guardrails system |
| `/coherence:check-principles [path]` | Review | Architecture compliance check against CLAUDE.md |
| `/coherence:check-drift [scope]` | Review | SPEC vs. codebase drift detection |
| `/coherence:test-runner [scope]` | Testing | Run tests with scope control |
| `/coherence:hook` | Inspection | List hooks with enforcement levels and status |
| `/coherence:spec` | Inspection | List SPEC docs with verification metadata |
| `/coherence:config` | Inspection | Unified overview of entire `.claude/` setup |
| `/coherence:history [options]` | Logging | View/control activity log |
| `/coherence:status [--prune]` | Global | Show global install state and repo registry |
| `/coherence:uninstall [--force] [--purge]` | Global | Remove Coherence from current repo |
| `/coherence:help` | Meta | Show available commands |

> **Project-local skill**: When installed into a project (via `/coherence:init` or manual copy), the skill uses sub-command dispatch with space syntax: `/coherence init`, `/coherence check-drift`, etc.

---

## Commands

> Examples below use plugin syntax (`/coherence:<command>`). If using the project-local skill, replace with space syntax (`/coherence <command>`).

### `/coherence:init [--reset]`

Interactive setup wizard that generates a complete `.claude/` guardrails system customized to your project — hooks, agents, skills, `CLAUDE.md`, and `settings.local.json`.

```
/coherence:init           # First-time setup
/coherence:init --reset   # Re-run wizard, regenerate everything
```

### `/coherence:check-principles [path]`

Architecture compliance check against the principles defined in your `CLAUDE.md`. Invokes the architecture-reviewer agent to validate code against security, boundary, performance, and propagation principles.

```
/coherence:check-principles              # Check staged changes
/coherence:check-principles src/api/     # Check a specific path
```

### `/coherence:check-drift [scope]`

Compare SPEC documents against the actual codebase to detect architectural drift. Invokes the drift-detector agent, which reads every SPEC document and reports items as CURRENT, DRIFTED, or UNDOCUMENTED.

```
/coherence:check-drift                   # Check all SPEC docs
/coherence:check-drift SPEC-API.md       # Check a specific SPEC
```

### `/coherence:test-runner [scope]`

Run tests with flexible scope control — all tests, a specific module, or a custom filter.

```
/coherence:test-runner                   # Run all tests
/coherence:test-runner auth              # Run tests matching "auth"
```

### `/coherence:hook`

List all installed Coherence hooks with their enforcement levels, tool matchers, and file status. Shows hooks grouped by execution phase (PreToolUse/PostToolUse) with active, orphaned, and missing status indicators.

```
/coherence:hook
```

Example output:

```
PreToolUse (6 hooks):
  Edit, Write:
    ● forbidden-imports.cjs    BLOCK   Block runtime-inappropriate APIs
    ● boundary-guard.cjs       BLOCK   Enforce module boundaries
    ● data-isolation.cjs       WARN    Warn on unfiltered DB queries
  Bash:
    ● test-gate.cjs            BLOCK   Block commits without tests
```

### `/coherence:spec`

List all SPEC documents with verification metadata — last verified date, verified by, and a one-line description extracted from each document's header.

```
/coherence:spec
```

Example output:

```
Found 3 SPEC documents in docs/:

  SPEC-HOOKS.md          verified 2026-02-25   Hook system (11 hooks, 3 tiers)
  SPEC-SKILLS.md         verified 2026-03-03   Skill system (1 skill, 11 sub-commands)
  SPEC-API.md            verified 2026-02-20   API endpoints and routes
```

### `/coherence:config`

Unified overview of your project's entire `.claude/` setup — hooks (with active/orphaned/missing status), agents, skills, SPEC documents, and project files like `CLAUDE.md`.

```
/coherence:config
```

Example output:

```
Hooks (.claude/hooks/):
  ● forbidden-imports.cjs     active
  ● boundary-guard.cjs        active
  4 active, 0 orphaned, 0 missing

Agents: 5   Skills: 1   SPECs: 3 (+ template)
CLAUDE.md: found, configured
```

### `/coherence:history [options]`

View the activity log recorded by hooks, or enable/disable hook logging.

```
/coherence:history                       # Show recent activity
/coherence:history --on                  # Turn on hook logging
/coherence:history --off                 # Turn off hook logging
```

### `/coherence:status [--prune]`

Show global Coherence install state — plugin config, registered repos, and stale entries. Useful for managing Coherence across multiple projects.

```
/coherence:status                        # Show install state
/coherence:status --prune                # Remove stale registry entries
```

Example output:

```
Registered Repos (2 total, 0 stale):
  ✓ /path/to/repo-1         registered 2026-01-15
  ✓ /path/to/repo-2         registered 2026-02-20
```

### `/coherence:uninstall [--force] [--purge]`

Remove Coherence hook registrations from the current repo. Does **not** delete `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `CLAUDE.md` — those contain your customizations. Use `--purge` to also delete project files.

```
/coherence:uninstall                     # Remove from current repo
/coherence:uninstall --force             # Also remove global config
/coherence:uninstall --purge             # Also delete project files
```

If other repos still use Coherence, global config is left intact unless `--force` is passed.

### `/coherence:help`

Show all available commands with descriptions.

```
/coherence:help
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory shows how the template adapts to different stacks:

### Express + PostgreSQL (`examples/express-api/`)

- CLAUDE.md adapted for Node.js/Express patterns
- `forbidden-imports.cjs` blocks browser APIs and `eval()`
- `data-isolation.cjs` checks for `org_id` in PostgreSQL queries

### Next.js + Prisma (`examples/next-app/`)

- CLAUDE.md adapted for Next.js App Router patterns
- `forbidden-imports.cjs` enforces server/client boundary (no Prisma in client components)
- `boundary-guard.cjs` ensures Prisma stays in `lib/db/`

---

## How It Works

**Hooks** run as small Node.js programs before/after Claude Code executes tools. They read the proposed change from stdin, check it against your constraints, and output a decision (block, warn, or allow).

**Agents** are specialized personas with defined tools and output formats. They're invoked by skills or automatically when the task matches their description.

**SPEC documents** are falsifiable descriptions of what the code currently does — not what it should do. They make claims like "we have 18 inspectors" that can be mechanically verified against the codebase.

**Skills** are named multi-step workflows. `/coherence:check-drift` doesn't just run a grep — it invokes the drift-detector agent, which reads every SPEC document, compares against code, and produces a structured report.

See [the blog post](blog/entropy-at-velocity.md) for the full rationale behind this approach.
